# Naïve Super 笔记
-by Loe, Erlend


This is what used to excite Lise when she was little:

This is what makes Kim happy:

#### Time

>
I think I’d like to have an atomic clock.
To compensate for the irregularity of the earth, a second is added now and then. The last time they added a second was in June 1994. Nobody ever said anything about that.
>
>The definition of time has changed due to atomic clocks. Before, a second used to be one-86,400th of a day, but now it has become 9,192,631,770 cycles of a caesium atom. I think it’s a lot.

#### The Bike


>
A boy on a tiny bicycle with side wheels comes over to me. He is wearing dungarees and a cap. And on top of his cap he has a blue bicycle helmet. He looks at me and at the milk I’ve bought. He asks if I’m the owner of the cool, red bike. I nod in the direction of my bike, which is parked against a wooden fence, and ask him if that’s the one he’s talking about. It is.


#### The Master

>
I fainted because what I was doing was so much fun that I didn’t have time to take a break.
Something about that is incredibly good. 
>
>That eagerness.

```
It should never have been different.
But such masters do not grow on trees.
I’ve never met a single master.
Everything points to me having to take care of myself.
I am trying to think who I look up to.
There aren’t many of them.
These I admire:
	– Laurie Anderson
	– Gandhi– The Salvation Army
	– Carl Barks– Astrid Lindgren
	– Orson Welles
	– Olav H. Hauge
	– Lars Lillo-Stenberg
I am convinced that it’s all about eagerness. That it’s missing.
I must find it. Get it back.
It’s out there.
It’s probably pointless to talk about it.
It’s a bit Zen.
I’ll never make it as long as I try to.
Only when I don’t try, will I make it.
Fucking Buddhists. They think they’re so bloody clever.
```

#### The Forest
>
For some reason I suspect that I know too much about things it’s stupid to know a whole lot about.

```
It’s a little late to talk about this now. Maybe a bit silly.
The damage is done.
I can’t pretend that I don’t know what I know.
But it’s crap. It really is.
```


```
Finne thought about it for a long while, and then he replied that not so long ago he had begun to notice that life, in a way, was a bit like a journey.
```

```
I don’t demand more from anything. Neither people nor objects.
```

#### The Girl
>
When Børre has finished the drawing, a fax comes through from my brother. Børre thinks it’s wonderful. A mystery. He doesn’t understand how it’s possible. A sheet of text coming straight into the room. He wants to know where it’s coming from. I tell him I think it’s from Africa.

#### Crazy love
>
I can’t quite tell whether the thoughts I’m having are my own or if they’re coming from the TV. 


#### Girlfriends

>
Why don’t I have a girlfriend? I can’t see any good reason. People not half as friendly as I have girlfriends. Idiots have girlfriends. I absolutely ought to have a girlfriend
>
>There is a lot of injustice and idiocy in the world. I guess that’s part of my problem.
>
>Or is it that these people are not really stupid, that they mean well, but fail over and over again?
>
>One sure thing is the fact that they have girlfriends. Every single one of them. But not me.

#### The Rain

```
I myself sit gazing at Jessica’s telephone number. It is also Lise’s telephone number. I want to call Lise and ask her if she’d like to meet me.
I am sweating. But I feel I have to call. I must do something. It’s time I did something. There are limits to how long I can sit indoors hammering.
They’re strange things, girls. One can’t avoid them. They’re so pretty. And they’re everywhere. They always make like nothing. I like their voices. I also like it when they laugh and smile. And when they walk. They’re also a bit scary. Sometimes I think they know something I don’t. But they’re pretty. And hard to get. It never ceases to amaze me that even the friendliest girls become attracted to the most rotten boys. My only chance is to not pretend.

I pace the room in a circle. Breathing deeply in and out. This is a small-scale hell. I hammer a little before I dial the number. It rings a few times. Then she picks up the receiver.

Now I’m talking to Lise.
When we’ve finished talking, I lie on the couch, smiling. It’s exactly as though it just stopped raining. Like it’s been raining and raining, but that it has finally stopped. And everything smells fragrant and the trees are all kinds of green.
There’s something very strange about girls. First they’re not there and everything is a little difficult. But then they’re there, and things become nicer. It happens incredibly fast. It only takes a few seconds before everything is nicer.
I’m meeting Lise in an hour. I’m quite nervous. I want to have a shower now.
```

#### Perspective

>
I don’t know what New York is like, but I can hardly imagine that it would be better than Lise.


>About ten percent of all the people who have ever lived on earth are alive now.


#### The City

>
Americans seem to live according to the simple theory that two is better than one, three is better than two, etc. For example, they believe two hundred dollars is better than one hundred. It’s a cute theory.

#### The Owl and the Pussycat

>
I am sitting on a bench looking at all the people. It’s good for me to see so many other people who are not me. That there are so many others. I feel affection for them. Most of them are doing the best they can. I am also doing the best I can.

#### Trees

>Trees are one of my favourite things. Water and trees and girls.


#### Journey

>I still don’t know if things fit together, or if everything will be all right in the end. But I believe that something means something. I believe in cleansing the soul through fun and games. I also believe in love. And I have several good friends, and just one bad one.
