# React Native Bridge

## What is React Native bridging?

> React Native Bridging is a concept that was developed by the React team to help the mobile app developers build their own custom modules, if not provided by the default Components given by React.
> 
> React Native provides developers with a variety of modules that developers can use to create functionality in the application. For example, React Native provides its own “Net Info” module to check for Internet Connectivity in applications. However, sometimes an app needs access to a platform API for which React doesn’t have a module yet. Or maybe the app needs a custom functionality that cannot be achieved using default React Native modules.
Hence, React Native allows us to write Native Code (Android and iOS) and communicate between native code and React Native JavaScript code to achieve custom-developed functionality.

> According to the documentation, React Native team believes that if React Native doesn’t support a native feature that you need, you should be able to build it yourself by using Bridging.

> There are two ways to bridge native code to JavaScript:
> 
	* Native Modules
	* Native UI Components
